New LLMs are emerging regularly with improved functionalities, \nefficiency, and expanding data that allow models to learn more effectively. The lack \nof guidelines for selecting the right LLMs for coding tasks makes the selection a \nsubjective choice by developers rather than a choice built on code complexity, code\nTrch dn: Refining chatgpt-generated code: Characterizing and mitigating\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGoogle Scholar gi thng bo ny cho bn v bn ang theo di nhng li trch dn mi trong cc bi vit ca \nThanh Le-Cong\n.\nLit k cnh bo\nHy thng bo", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/15/2/119&hl=vi&sa=X&d=13499206692228798048&ei=FSyTadXuJe7QieoP9dTwkAI&scisig=AFtJQizwsspowU1575iMUo5tjxxY&oi=scholaralrt&hist=70gU4M0AAAAJ:6246953642887790424:AFtJQixCQ81pAaZO62Nxbsaf_ECn&html=&pos=0&folt=cit", "author": ["Thanh Le-Cong"], "ref": ["1 l\u1eddi tr\u00edch d\u1eabn m\u1edbi \u0111\u1ebfn b\u00e0i vi\u1ebft c\u1ee7a Thanh Le-Cong"]}
