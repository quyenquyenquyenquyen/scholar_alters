While previous investigations on the correctness of AI-generated code \nare widely present, less focus has been placed on the code's further quality attributes \nand how it can be improved. An aspect that can be equally important. This thesis \naims to fill this gap by investigating how LLMs can be guided to generate code that \naligns with software quality principles.
